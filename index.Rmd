# The Golem of Prague  

Right now Iâ€™m just trying to work through what seems to be 4 years of reading statistical rethinking and learning statistics. Bare bones right now but hoping to make this more of a thing moving forward. Going to try and keep the context within a natural resource framework (fisheries, hydrology, soils).

I won't go into Chapter 1 because it's mostly for you to read on your own. Great content and outline for the rest of the book but not much to put on here.
